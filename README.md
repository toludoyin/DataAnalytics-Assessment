This session identify customers who have funded accounts and completed successful transaction. The required columns were aggregated to get the relevant data to find those customers who hold both a savings plan and an investment plan.


2. Transaction Frequency Analysis

3. Account Inactivity Alert
   
In this session, users were identified by assigning row numbers to active accounts holding either savings or investment plans. The date of each user’s last successful transaction was then used to calculate their inactivity period in days.


3. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Estimation
   
To calculate the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), a profit margin of 0.1% per transaction was applied to each user’s total transaction value. Additionally, the tenure was determined by calculating the number of months between the current date and the user’s signup date.
